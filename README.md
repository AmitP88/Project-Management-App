# Project-Management-App

### Note: 

Since this has a front end and a backend, run ``npm install`` once for the project root directory (/project-management-app) and again for the client directory (/project-management-app/client). Then run ``npm run dev`` command while in the project root directory (/project-management-app) to launch both the react app and the node server.

I'm currently working on the mobile view first, so to view the best preview of this project, do the following:

- 1.) Run ``npm run dev`` to launch the app in the browser

- 2.) In the browser, open up developer tools and click on the mobile icon in the toolbar (Toggle device toolbar icon) to run the mobile emulator.
      
- 3.) In the mobile emulator, click on the top bar labeled Mobile - S 320px to view the app on the small-sized mobile view. This is the best view of the app so far.

#### What the App Looks Like in Mobile View (tablet/desktop views will be available later on)
